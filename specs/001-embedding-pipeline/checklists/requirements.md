# Specification Quality Checklist: Embedding Pipeline Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [specs/001-embedding-pipeline/spec.md](../../specs/001-embedding-pipeline/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Technology-specific references removed*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items have been completed successfully.
- The specification is ready for the planning phase.
- Technology-specific references (Cohere, Qdrant) have been replaced with generic terms where appropriate to maintain technology-agnostic language.
