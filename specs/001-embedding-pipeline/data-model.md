# Data Model: Embedding Pipeline

## Document Content
**Description**: Represents the text extracted from Docusaurus pages, including the raw text and source URL metadata

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the document chunk
- `url` (string): Original URL from which the content was extracted
- `content` (string): Clean text content extracted from the page
- `title` (string): Page title extracted from HTML
- `created_at` (datetime): Timestamp when the content was extracted
- `chunk_index` (integer): Index of this chunk if the document was split

**Validation**:
- URL must be a valid URL format
- Content must not be empty
- Created_at must be in ISO format

## Embedding Vector
**Description**: Represents the numerical vector representation of text content generated by the embedding service

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for this embedding (matches document content id)
- `vector` (list[float]): Numerical vector representation of the text
- `document_id` (string): Reference to the original document content
- `created_at` (datetime): Timestamp when the embedding was generated

**Validation**:
- Vector must have consistent dimensions
- Document_id must reference an existing document content
- Vector values must be finite numbers

## Vector Database Collection
**Description**: Represents the storage unit in the vector database where embeddings are stored with associated metadata for retrieval

**Fields**:
- `name` (string): Name of the collection ("rag_embedding" as specified)
- `size` (integer): Number of embeddings stored in the collection
- `dimensions` (integer): Dimensionality of the stored vectors
- `created_at` (datetime): When the collection was created

**Validation**:
- Name must follow Qdrant naming conventions
- Dimensions must be consistent across all vectors in collection
- Size must be non-negative

## Processing Pipeline
**Description**: Represents the workflow that orchestrates crawling, text extraction, embedding generation, and storage operations

**Fields**:
- `status` (string): Current status of the pipeline (e.g., "running", "completed", "failed")
- `source_url` (string): Root URL being processed
- `total_documents` (integer): Number of documents processed
- `processed_documents` (integer): Number of documents completed
- `start_time` (datetime): When the pipeline started
- `end_time` (datetime): When the pipeline completed (if finished)
- `errors` (list): List of any errors encountered during processing

**Validation**:
- Status must be one of the defined values
- Source URL must be valid
- Processed documents must not exceed total documents
